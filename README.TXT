# Project Archer

This is an old project me and my friends wrote in 10th grade. 
It uses a *Processing* library for *BlueJ* to provide a `setup()` and `draw()` method.

The game is based on the free mobile game [Archero](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habby.archero&hl=de&gl=US&pli=1).
